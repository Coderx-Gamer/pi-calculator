# Pi Calculator
I made this because of pi day, not really a practical program.

This program uses the Leibniz formula (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leibniz_formula_for_%CF%80 for details). 

# How to use:

When booting up the program it should look like this:

If not, please report an issue.

Step #1: Enter a positive integer in the iterations field (this is for the number of iterations for the Leibniz formula and the higher this value is the more accurate your answer will be).

Step #2: Enter a positive integer in the precision field (this will be the amount of digits that the program will give you, some being incorrect depending on the iterations field, this value does not increase accuracy, just the amount of digits the program will actually give you).

Step #3: Press calculate, in some amount of time the answer will show up in the box below, beware that not all digits are correct depending on your program settings.

Happy pi day!
